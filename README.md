# SpoonOS Developer Call - Scoop Future

## Overview

Welcome to the SpoonOS Developer Call program! This initiative aims to engage developers in building innovative solutions using SpoonOS core technologies. Through this program, we seek to validate our technology, build our ecosystem, and identify key contributors to the SpoonOS platform.

## Targets

1. **Technical Validation**: Attract developers to try the core functions of SpoonOS.
2. **Ecosystem Building**: Accumulate AI + Web3 scenarios and improvement ideas from real-world applications.
3. **Developer Activation**: Identify and nurture core building contributors.

## Program Structure

Participants will experience three phases of work:

### 1. Proposal Phase

In this phase:

- SpoonOS team will provide proposal samples, but developers can choose to use these or create their own.
- If using a sample proposal, developers must submit a sample issue in the Scoop GitHub repository for tracking.
- If creating an original proposal, it must include:
  - Problem description or pain points
  - Target users
  - Technical plan (core functions and product structure)

The SpoonOS team will review and approve proposals before developers can proceed to the coding phase.

**For MCP Server Proposals**:

If you're building an MCP Server, your proposal must include:

- What is the _XXX_ MCP Server
- How to use the _XXX_ MCP Server
- Key features of _XXX_ MCP Server
- Use cases of _XXX_ MCP Server
- Tools included in the MCP Server

### 2. Coding Phase

Once a proposal is approved:

- Developers can start coding their solution
- Developers can reference the [SpoonOS GitHub repository](https://github.com/XSpoonAi/spoon-core) for documentation
- Developers can submit issues under spoon-core to:
  1. Report bugs
  2. Request features from SpoonOS
  3. Improve documentation
  4. Address development blockers
  5. Submit as a GitHub source code repository

The SpoonOS team will review issues and may either:

- Ask the developer to submit a PR to resolve the issue (with additional rewards)
- Fix the issue in-house

Developers who submit PRs that are accepted will receive contributor status on Discord.

### 3. Audit Phase

After completing the project:

- Developers must submit their GitHub repository link to their proposal issue
- The GitHub repository must be open source
- Developers must submit a demo video that:
  - Is less than 5 minutes long
  - Shows the project functioning on its intended device
  - Is uploaded to YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook Video, or Youku
  - Does not include third-party trademarks or copyrighted material without permission
- The project must be original work, solely owned by the submitter, and not violate any IP rights
- Popularity votes will be considered in judging (developers are encouraged to share their work on X)

All participants with successful submissions will receive a Builder role on Neo Discord and 5000 Global Beacon points.

## Rewards

SpoonOS will select excellent projects for rewards based on the following levels:
