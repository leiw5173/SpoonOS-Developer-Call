# Proposal: MCP Client ü§ù MCP Server DID Solution Based on SpoonOS

## Problem Description

- MCP (Model Context Protocol) aims to enable seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources/tools
- Current interaction between MCP Clients and MCP Servers relies heavily on OAuth solutions
- OAuth implementations are often complex, centralized, and require significant development overhead
- Identity verification between MCP Clients and Servers lacks standardization and interoperability
- OAuth token management creates security vulnerabilities and administrative challenges
- Severity: Medium-High, affecting the entire MCP ecosystem's security, usability, and adoption rate
- Lack of decentralized identity solutions limits the true potential of open protocols like MCP

## Business Opportunity

- Target customers: AI application developers, MCP Server providers, enterprise AI solution architects, Web3 identity platforms
- Market size: Global digital identity solutions market valued at $23.3 billion, expected to grow to $49.5 billion by 2026
- Potential business models:
  - DID-as-a-Service for MCP ecosystem participants (subscription-based, $50-200/month)
  - Enterprise integration services for custom DID implementation ($10,000-50,000 per client)
  - Developer SDK licensing for MCP Client builders (freemium model with premium features)
  - Verification credential marketplace (transaction fee-based, 1-3% per verification)
- Estimated development cost: $120,000-180,000 for MVP (including protocol design and reference implementation)
- Competitive advantage: First-to-market DID solution specifically designed for MCP ecosystem, leveraging SpoonOS's security and interoperability frameworks

## Technical Plan

- Solution approach: Develop a decentralized identity (DID) protocol tailored for MCP Client-Server authentication and authorization
- Unique aspects:
  - Self-sovereign identity management for MCP participants
  - Verifiable credential-based access control
  - Chain-agnostic DID resolution system
  - Cryptographic proof of identity without centralized authorities
- SpoonOS technology integration:
  - SpoonOS Core Framework for DID registry and resolution
  - SpoonOS Privacy Module for secure credential storage and verification
  - SpoonOS Security Framework for cryptographic operations and key management
  - SpoonOS Coordination Layer for cross-chain DID interoperability
  - SpoonOS MCP+ for seamless integration with existing MCP implementations
  - SpoonOS BeVec for efficient credential indexing and retrieval
- Technical decisions:
  - W3C-compliant DID method specification
  - Zero-knowledge proof mechanisms for privacy-preserving verification
  - Decentralized key management system with recovery mechanisms
  - Standardized credential schema for MCP-specific permissions
  - Implementation of DID-based authentication protocol extensions for MCP
- Implementation complexity: Medium-High - requires cryptographic expertise and protocol design experience
